fsScan is the data collection program for the fsReport application.

Usage: fsScan [<scan-root>] [-cfg <config-file>] [-dtl <detail-file>] [-f]
			  [-ads] [-touch | -recall] [-nsacl] [-threads n]
			  [-log <log-file>] [-err <err-file>] [-debug <debug-level>]

where:
	<scan-root>
		specifies the root directory at which to begin the file scan.  If this
		paramter is not present, the -cfg <configuration-file> option must be
		used to specify an scan root.
	-cfg <config-file>
		specifies the configuration filename.  The syntax of this file is
		described below.
	-dtl <detail-file>
		specifies the file to receive the details of the scan.  This file is
		then used as input to fsReport to produce detail file-level reports.
		If the option is not present, its default is fsScan.dtl.
	-f
		unconditionally deletes an existing .dtl file with the same name.
	-ads
		if present, this option causes the scan to include information about
		Alternate Data Streams attached to files.  This will increase the time
		required for the scan.  This option is incompatible with -touch and
		-recall.
	-touch | -recall  -- USE WITH CAUTION, READ THE DOCUMENTATION
		if present, these options cause the program to recall the archived
		files pointed to by DHSM stubs.  The two options recall the files in
		different ways.  Before choosing either one, please review the fsScan
		documentation.
	-nsacl
		bypasses the collection of the SACL portion of file permissions.  This
		option must be present if the account running the program does not have
		the 'Manage auditing and security log' local access right.	
	-threads n
		specifies the number of file processing threads.  The defaualt is 32.
	-log <log-file> and -err <err-file>
		specify files to receive the execution log and any error messages.
		If they are not specified, the defaults at stdout and stderr.
	-debug <debug-level>
		Integer between 1 and 4.  Specifies level of debug information.

Configuration file
------------------
This file is used to specify include/exclude files and directories for the
scan root.  It must have a single [ScanRoot] section which contains a path
parameter if the root scan path was not specified on the command line and,
optionally, one or more include/exclude directory or file parameters.
Its form is

[ScanRoot]
path		 = <LocalDrivePath-or-UNC-path>
includedirs  = <dir-template>
excludedirs  = <dir-template>
includefiles = <file-template>
excludefiles = <file-template>

The <dir-template> and <file-template> values may contain wildcard characters
with the following meanings:

	? - any single character not including a path separator
	* - zero or more characters not including a path separator
	~ - zero or more characters
