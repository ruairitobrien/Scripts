fsReport is the report generation partner application of fsScan

Usage: fsReport [-dtl <detail-file>] [-rdir <report-directory]
 				[-cfg <configuration-file>] [-q "<query-select>"]
				[-l <list-file>] [-e <err-file>]
				[-cat all | -cat <category1> -cat <category2> ...]
where:

	-dtl <detail-file>
		specifies the name of a .dtl file created by fsScan.  If this option
		is not present, the default is 'fScan.dtl'
	-cfg <configuration-file>
		specifies the name of a configuration file which contains the report
		definitions and parameters.  If this option is not present, a simple
		summary of the contents of the detail file is displayed.  For the format
		and contents of the configuration file, see the product documentation.
	-q "<query-select>"
		specifies criteria to select entries from the .dtl file for an ad-hoc
		report that does not require creating a configuration file.  For the
		syntax of <query-select>, refer to the fsTools documentation.  This
		string must be enclosed in double-quotes.
	-rdir <report-directory>
		specifies a target directory for reports defined in the configuration
		file.  If the last component in the path does not exist, it will be
		created.  If present, this option overrides the ReportDirectory option
		in the configuration file.
	-l <list-file>  -and-  -e <err-file>
		specify the output list file and error file.  If these options are not
		present, the defaults are stdout and stderr, respectively.
	-cat all | -cat <category>
		when present, this option specifies which report categories are selected
		in the configuration file.  The option '-cat all' selects all categories.
		For a description of report category specification in the configuration
		file, see the product documentation.
